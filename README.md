Bet it'll slip into your stack with no questions?
Bet you won't escape this debugger's prison?
I play with her memory, baby, where’s your pointer?
Blasting DOOM OST, she compiles my shader.
Leaving the engine, black coffee and pain in hand.
Peeled off the monitor, stuck in a core dump.
I throw a null ref — you’ll catch it yourself.
Hey, code, are you production or a dead load?</span>
