# My style

The rarest bug, but the cruelest crasher.

Bet it'll slip into your stack with no questions?

Bet you won't escape this debugger's prison?

I play with her memory, baby, where’s your pointer?

Blasting DOOM OST, she compiles my shader.

Leaving the engine, black coffee and pain in hand.

Peeled off the monitor, stuck in a core dump.

I throw a null ref — you’ll catch it yourself.

Hey, code, are you production or a dead load?
